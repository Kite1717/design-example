Choice of colour in websites
=======================

Three websites are being chosen and their colour scheme and typography is documented and analysed.
The analysis focuses on the effect of the colour scheme amd the typography has on the viewer.

Selection
-----------------------

The websites were chosen on basis of what I am in contact with.
I consciously decided to not choose the websites that 
I like or that are united by a certain topic/aspect.
The reason behind this choice is that I wanted to see what kind of palette and design I, as an average user, being subjected to. So I have chosen websites that were in from of me.
The chosen websites are:
* [hanzo.es](https://hanzo.es/)
* [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/)
* [asoftmurmur](https://asoftmurmur.com/)

Method
-----------------------

I take screenshots of the website as it appears in the browser, excluding the browser UI.
I use [geotest.net](https://www.geotests.net/couleurs/) to map the colours from the website onto a chromatic circle. Based on the circle and identify the type of colour scheme
based on [An Introduction to Color Theory for Web Designers](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-color-theory-for-web-designers--webdesign-1437) article.
I record the typography choices for h1-h3 and main text on each website using devtools,
wherever available.
I am using my BA in Fine Art and previous work as a designer and maker to pass personal 
judgements about the intentions of the designers in use of the selected colour
scheme and how successful the design is.

Analysis
-----------------------

**Colour scheme**

Despite an unintentional selection of the sites there are similarities between them. All of the analysed sites use what could be argued to have a variation on a split complimentary scheme. 
All of the sites use colour to highlight utility in a consequential manner and 2/3 to reinforce
the brand identity as well.

All of the analysed websites are using sans-serif fonts which seems to be a trend in we design  at the moment.
The consciously selected fonts serve as part of the brand identity in case of hanzo.es - it is used both for the logo and headers. Instagram is using a font that is also claimed by other well known and developed sites as airbnb.com which signals to me affinity with the familiar, as well as with the well-established. Topshopnails.ru is using the now ubiquitous and falling-out-of-favour Helvetica Neue.

I believe colours are chosen for an association with being friendly and playful, lighthearted and approachable. 
Perhaps that is the owners desired image or the feeling they want the visitors to experience. The three main colours
used in the first three letters of the logo 'SIMPLE' are echoed through headers and links throughout the site. 
The other three colours in the logo are chosen perhaps to complement the
first three and are not used.
Why? My guess is to not overwhelm the audience with visual queues and establish 
quick recognisable navigation in line with the brand identity.

I would like to argue that the third site doesn't have a thought-through color scheme. 
The gradient colours used throughout the site to highlight functional elements are not part of the logo. The other two colours (green and yellow) could be at a stretched placed as a double-split complimentary palette. Coincidentally the gradient is very similar as on instagram site, 
however used in a very different proportion against a white background. 
Its vibrancy serves the purpose of drawing attention, but together with 
other colours I am not at all sure whether the designer who picked them
wanted me to have a certain (emotional) experience at all aside from
directing my gaze. Being familiar with the brand's owner and clientele 
via her Instagram I would say that the site doesn't reflect either successfully.
